# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe Game with Leaderboard

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, complete with a leaderboard functionality. The project is structured into three main files:

    main.py: This is the entry point of the game. It welcomes players to the Tic Tac Toe game and provides them with instructions to start playing.

    game.py: This file contains the core logic of the Tic Tac Toe game, including the management of player turns and the game field.

    leaderboard.py: This script manages the game's leaderboard, including functions to clear and show the leaderboard.

Additionally, there is a CSV file (leaderboard.csv) used for storing the leaderboard data.
